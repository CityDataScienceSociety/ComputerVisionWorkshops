# Detect Fire with AI
## Training a Convolutional Neural Network for a Computer Vision Binary Classification Task

In this workshop we will see the basic workflow for creating a model that, based on a training image dataset, predicts if a given image is of one class (fire) or another (no fire).

With a set of training images containing labelled examples of both classes, the network will *learn* how to distinguish (in this case) two classes.
